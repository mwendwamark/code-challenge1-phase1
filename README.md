# This program is based on grading the students marks.
The marks are between 0 marks to 100 marks.
Anything below 0 (eg. -74  ) , above 100 (eg. 301) or a string, counts as an invalid grade, and it returns a message "This is an invalid mark. Please try again"

The are five grades and each grade has a limit according to the marks namely:
*Grade "A" = anything > 79 && < 101
*Grade "B" = anything > 59 && < 78
*Grade "C" = anything > 48 && < 58
*Grade "D" = anything > 39 && < 48
*Grade "E" = anything > 0  && <= 40
