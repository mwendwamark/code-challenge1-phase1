# Speed Detector
# Description
This program takes the speed of a car as input and determines if the driver is over the speed limit. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it outputs "Ok". If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, it calculates the number of demerit points the driver should receive, based on how much they were exceeding the speed limit. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program outputs "License suspended".
